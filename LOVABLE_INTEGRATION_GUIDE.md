1. Advanced ML explanation UI
2. Social features and user connections
3. Admin dashboard for event management
4. Real-time viral event detection
5. Analytics and A/B testing framework
```

### Step 2: Setup Lovable Project

#### 2.1 Create New Lovable Project
1. Go to [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)
2. Create new project: "Copenhagen Event Recommender"
3. Choose React + TypeScript template

#### 2.2 Upload Prepared Files
Upload these files to Lovable:
- `openapi.json` (exported schema)
- Project brief (from above)
- `types/api.ts` (TypeScript definitions)
- `lib/api.ts` (API client)
- `tailwind.config.js` (Copenhagen theme)

### Step 3: Generate Base Frontend

#### 3.1 Initial Generation
Provide Lovable with:
```
Generate a Copenhagen nightlife event discovery app with:
1. Event feed with recommendation cards
2. Like/dislike/going interaction buttons  
3. Filter panel for genre/price/location
4. User onboarding flow
5. Search functionality
6. Event detail pages
7. Dark theme with neon accents

Use the provided OpenAPI schema for all API integration.
```

#### 3.2 Iterate on Design
Request improvements:
- "Make the event cards more visually appealing with glassmorphism"
- "Add smooth animations for interactions"
- "Improve the filter UI with better Copenhagen neighborhood selection"
- "Add map view integration"

### Step 4: Post-Lovable Customization

#### 4.1 Advanced Features to Add
```typescript
// Enhanced event card with ML explanations
const EventCardEnhanced = ({ event, explanation }) => {
  return (
    <div className="event-card glass-effect">
      {/* Lovable base card */}
      <ExplanationTooltip reasons={explanation.reasons} />
      <ViralIndicator isViral={event.source === 'viral'} />
      <SwipeGestures onSwipe={handleInteraction} />
    </div>
  );
};

// Real-time recommendation updates
const useRealtimeRecommendations = () => {
  // WebSocket connection for live updates
  // Social proof notifications
  // Viral event alerts
};
```

#### 4.2 Copenhagen-Specific Enhancements
```typescript
// Neighborhood color coding
const neighborhoodColors = {
  'Vesterbro': '#ff0080', // Pink
  'N√∏rrebro': '#39ff14',  // Green  
  'Indre By': '#00f5ff',  // Cyan
  'Christiania': '#8a2be2' // Purple
};

// Local venue recognition
const VenueCard = ({ venue }) => (
  <div className={`venue-card ${getVenueStyle(venue.name)}`}>
    <VenueReputation score={venue.popularity} />
    <TransportLinks venue={venue} />
  </div>
);
```

### Step 5: Integration & Testing

#### 5.1 Connect to Backend
```bash
# Update environment variables
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env.local

# Test API connection
npm run dev
# Verify recommendations load correctly
```

#### 5.2 Add Advanced Features
1. **ML Explanations**: Why events were recommended
2. **Viral Detection**: Highlight trending events from social scraping
3. **Social Features**: See what friends are attending
4. **Analytics**: Track user behavior and recommendation performance

#### 5.3 Performance Optimization
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- API response caching with SWR
- Virtual scrolling for long event lists
- Service worker for offline capability

### Step 6: Deployment

#### 6.1 Vercel Deployment (Lovable can help)
```bash
# Lovable can generate deployment config
vercel --prod
```

#### 6.2 Environment Setup
```bash
# Production environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your_analytics_id
```

## Expected Timeline

‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration  
‚úÖ **API Integration**: Seamless backend connection  
‚úÖ **Customization Ready**: Clean codebase for our enhancements  

## Next Steps

1. **Prepare the OpenAPI export** (5 minutes)
2. **Create Lovable project with brief** (15 minutes)  
3. **Generate and iterate on frontend** (2-4 hours)
4. **Add Copenhagen-specific features** (1-2 days)
5. **Deploy and test** (30 minutes)

This hybrid approach gives us a production-ready frontend foundation while preserving the ability to add our unique Copenhagen nightlife features and advanced ML capabilities!
